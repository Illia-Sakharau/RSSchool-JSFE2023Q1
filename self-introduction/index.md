>Hi everyone. I'm Ilya and I want to be a Front-end developer.
Let me introduce myself.


> #### About me
>Iâ€™m originally from Belarus, but now I live in Georgia.
In 2016 I graduated from Belarusian State University of Transport and started to work at Belarusian Railway as an engineer. 
After for 4 years of working there, I quit in autumn 2020 and decided to start my own way in IT. Since I was fond of design I decided to choose this direction. And at the beginning of 2021 I got a job as a UX/UI designer. During this time I closely communicated with the Front-end department and realized that the development was closer to my heart. 
At the beginning of 2023, after 2 years, the project I worked on lost its funding. I got unemployed and decided this was a sign to change my direction to Front-end so I enrolled on a JavaScript/Front-end 2023 course. Fortunately, I had a basic knowledge of HTML, CSS and JS.

> #### What did I learn on stage1?
>On stage1 I: 
>- refreshed my knowledge of HTML, CSS;
>- deepened my knowledge of JavaScript;
>- gained basic knowledge of node.js;
>- I learned how to use git and GitHub;
>- I learned to configure and use WebPack;
>- and  etc.


> #### My projects
>- Shelter two-page application.
>- Virtual keyboard.
>- My biggest project to date is the game Minesweeper. 
>Eah, it was a really interesting experience!

> #### What do I expect from stage2?
>On stage2 I would like to strengthen and expand my Front-end knowledge as well as gain new ones.
I believe that my Front-end skills under a mentor will grow and the code will become cleaner and more productive.

> #### In conclusion
>I am very happy that The Rolling Scopes School provides the opportunity to learn a new profession, and I express my gratitude to the organizers and everyone involved.
>Thank you for watching! All the best!
